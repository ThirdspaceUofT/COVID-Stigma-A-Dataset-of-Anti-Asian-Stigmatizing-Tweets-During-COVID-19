This repository contains the Datasets (versions 1.0, 1.1, 2.0, 3.0 and 3.1) and labeling Instructions related to the paper [1] done at [ThirdSpace Lab](https://thirdspace.toronto.edu/), University of Toronto.

Data Set v3.0 contains 11,263 manually annotatgedÂ English tweets with primary labels(unknown/irrelevant, not-stigmatizing, stigmatizing-low, stigmatizing-medium, stigmatizing-high) and tweet subtopics (eg, wet market and eating habits, COVID-19 cases, bioweapon). Data Set v3.1 contains 4998 (44.4%) tweets randomly sampled from Data Set v3.0, where a second annotator labeled them only on the primary labels and then a third annotator resolved conflicts between the first and second annotators. This high quality twitter dataset on stigma towards the Asian population can be used as a benchmark for further qualitative and quantitative research and analysis around the issue.
